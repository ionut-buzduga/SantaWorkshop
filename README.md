# SantaWorkshop
Concurrent and Distributed Systems Year 3 semester 1 Project


These are the instructions for the application to run:
 
First, we need to start the server connection by running the WorkshopServer 
As a Java Application.
Then(and this is very important) we need to leave the WorkshopServer process running for the moment.

Only after we run the second application class:Workshop the connection to the server will be successfully made.
 
To check if the connection has been made you can run the WorkshopServer application once again 
 
And if you get the message that the Listen socket is already in use: bind-then the connection was established
